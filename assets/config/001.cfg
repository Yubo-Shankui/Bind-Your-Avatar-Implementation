--prompt "An elderly man and a young boy sit on a park bench. The elderly man, seated on the left, loosely holds a newspaper in his lap with his hands resting gently on the pages. The boy, seated on the right, has his hands placed neatly on his thighs and wears a soft, attentive expression, subtly tilting his head as if listening carefully to the elder. The background is a serene landscape of green grassy expanse and towering trees, their leaves still in the quiet air, reinforcing the peaceful moment of quiet communication between the two figures."
